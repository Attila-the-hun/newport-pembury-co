                <!-- Opening paragraph with drop cap -->
                <p class="opening-paragraph">Most founders spend years building something worth acquiring — and weeks preparing it for the deal table. It's an imbalance that shows up in the data: roughly seven out of ten M&A transactions fail to create the value they promised. Not because the businesses were flawed, but because the financial foundations weren't ready for scrutiny.</p>

                <p>This isn't a story about bad deals. It's about good businesses that weren't prepared to demonstrate their value under the unforgiving lens of due diligence. And for founders in the $5M to $50M revenue range, where every dollar of EBITDA directly affects the multiple, the cost of unpreparedness is measured in hundreds of thousands — sometimes millions.</p>

                </div>

                <p>There are two valuations in every deal. The first is the one the founder carries in their head — shaped by years of sweat equity, revenue growth, and the figure their accountant mentioned at last year's review. The second is the one that emerges when a buyer's advisory team opens the data room.</p>

                <p>The gap between these two numbers is where deals collapse. Not at the negotiation table, but in the quiet weeks of financial review where every assumption is tested against documentation.</p>

                    <p>The gap between what a founder believes their business is worth and what a buyer can verify is where most deals quietly collapse.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>We see this pattern repeatedly in our advisory work. A founder with a genuinely strong business — $4M in revenue, healthy margins, recurring clients — enters an acquisition conversation expecting a 5x to 6x multiple. But their financials tell a muddled story: revenue recognition policies that shift year to year, key customer contracts that live in email threads rather than signed agreements, and cost allocations that would challenge even a seasoned analyst.</p>

                <p>The buyer's team doesn't see a $4M business worth $24M. They see risk. And risk compresses multiples.</p>

                    <h2>Due Diligence: Where Deals Go to Die</h2>
                </div>

                <p>Due diligence is not a formality. It is a forensic examination of every financial claim a business makes. For founders who've built their company with operational excellence but financial pragmatism, this process can be deeply confronting.</p>

                <p>The common failure points are surprisingly consistent:</p>

                <ul class="diamond-list">
                    <li><strong>Revenue quality</strong> — Is revenue recurring, contractual, or project-based? Buyers pay very different multiples for each.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earnings normalisation</strong> — Are owner benefits, one-off costs, and related-party transactions clearly separated? Muddled earnings create doubt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working capital patterns</strong> — Does the business consume cash as it grows, or generate it? This directly affects the price paid at completion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer concentration</strong> — If one client represents 30% of revenue, the buyer is acquiring a dependency, not a diversified business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Systems and reporting</strong> — Can the financial team produce accurate monthly P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow within 10 business days of month-end? If not, the buyer questions everything.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each of these issues, individually, is manageable. Together, they form a pattern that signals to buyers: this business hasn't been run with an exit in mind. And that perception — whether fair or not — costs real money at the deal table.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The businesses that command premium multiples share a common trait: their financial infrastructure was built 18 to 24 months before anyone started talking about a transaction. Not because the founders planned to sell — though some did — but because they recognised that the disciplines required for a successful exit are the same ones that make a business better to run.</p>

                <p>In our experience, the financial infrastructure that transforms deal outcomes includes three layers:</p>

                <p>This sounds basic because it is — and yet, in our advisory practice, fewer than one in five businesses in the $5M to $50M range have even the foundation layer in place when they first engage us. The analysis layer turns historical data into forward-looking intelligence — exactly what a buyer needs to underwrite future performance. And the strategic layer is what separates a business that can be acquired from one that commands a premium.</p>

                    <h2>The Founder Blind Spot</h2>
                </div>

                <p>There's a cognitive bias at work in nearly every unprepared deal. Founders who've built a business from nothing develop a deep, intuitive understanding of its value. They know which clients are loyal, which revenue streams are growing, and which team members are irreplaceable. This knowledge is real and valuable — but it's invisible to a buyer who can only see what's documented.</p>

                <p>The founder's blind spot is the assumption that the buyer will see the business the way they do. They won't. A buyer sees a spreadsheet, a data room, and a management presentation. If the story those documents tell is incomplete, the buyer fills in the gaps with their own assumptions — and those assumptions always discount value.</p>

                <p>In our early M&A advisory work, we underestimated the timeline for financial clean-up. A business that we believed was six months from deal-readiness turned out to need fourteen months of foundational work before we could confidently open a data room. That experience fundamentally shapes how we prepare founders today: we start with the assumption that the financial infrastructure needs more work than anyone expects.</p>

                    <h2>Preparing for Value, Not Just Transaction</h2>
                </div>

                <p>The most important shift a founder can make is to stop thinking about M&A preparation as deal preparation and start thinking about it as value preparation. The distinction matters because it changes the timeline, the priorities, and the mindset.</p>

                <p>Deal preparation is reactive — it starts when a buyer appears or when a founder decides to sell. Value preparation is proactive — it starts the moment a founder decides that their business should be worth what they believe it's worth, whether they sell next year or in ten years.</p>

                <p>The practical steps are deceptively straightforward:</p>

                <ul class="diamond-list">
                    <li><strong>Audit your data room readiness</strong> — Could you open a virtual data room tomorrow and populate it with 24 months of clean financials, all key contracts, and a management presentation? If not, start here.</li>
                    <li><strong>Commission a quality of earnings analysis</strong> — Before a buyer does it, do it yourself. Understand what your normalised EBITDA actually is and what adjustments a buyer would make.</li>
                    <li><strong>Map your revenue quality</strong> — Categorise every revenue stream by type (recurring, contractual, project), customer tenure, and concentration. This is the single most impactful analysis for valuation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build the reporting cadence</strong> — Monthly financials within 10 days, quarterly board packs, annual strategic review. The discipline itself is a signal to buyers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>None of this requires a transaction in progress. All of it makes the business more valuable, more investable, and more resilient — regardless of what comes next.</p>

                    <p class="takeaway-label">The Bottom Line</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roughly 70% of M&A deals fail to create promised value — most often due to financial unpreparedness, not business quality.</li>
                        <li>The gap between founder perception and buyer verification is where multiples compress and deals collapse.</li>
                        <li>Financial infrastructure should be built 18–24 months before any transaction conversation begins.</li>
                        <li>Three layers of readiness — foundation, analysis, and strategic — separate premium outcomes from discounted ones.</li>
                        <li>Value preparation is proactive and ongoing; deal preparation is reactive and expensive.</li>
